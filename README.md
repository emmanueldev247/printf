## _printf()

**Emmanuel Ademola** and **Olivera Wilson**, Software Engineering students at ALX, have jointly developed the "\_printf()" function. 

This function mimics the behavior of the standard "printf()" command from the C programming language's stdio.h library. It encompasses several fundamental features and functions documented in "printf" manual 3. `man 3 printf()`


The function `_printf()` is designed to carry out formatted output conversion and display data. Its prototype is as follows:
```
	  int _printf(const char *format, ...) 
```
Where **format** contains the string that is printed.
